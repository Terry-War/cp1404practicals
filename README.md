# Brief info on myself and this class
Hello, my name is Terry, and ive been studying IT related subjects for 18 months.

CP1404 is the second programming subject to help introduce and reinforce good programming habits
# What have I learned about clean code:

- Utilizing the menu pattern available on the programming patterns to make easy to read and use menus.
- Using the basic error checking method or the try>if>else and except error checking depending on the use of the program.
- Remembering to use the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) method.
