# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually within about 10 minutes or so

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I seemed to get the hang of estimating how long a task would take fairly quickly. i could have a quick look at 
git page and tell that it would take an hour and get to and have it done within that hour like i thought.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned I could judge the difficulty of a given task pretty easily and thus I
knew if I was going to need to bring a drink and something to eat while I was doing the prac

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

That most people don't read the instructions well enough to ask the correct person to code review. 
I have only had 3 proper code reviews by other students.
And most of those simply said "Good work"

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I tried to look at other students code but was not very good at seeing anything wrong straight away. 
typically I choose to look at the most obvious things like docstrings and the time estimates.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code review for Sunghayo](https://github.com/Sunghayo/cp1404practicals/pull/6)

### Explanation

 I've added a few comments about some minor things about Sunghayo's code. 
 Mostly the time estimate for the creation of the code. 
 It seems that they may not be merging the feedback branch's on pycharm correctly as they sent me week 7, 
 week 8 and week 9's prac for code review under week 9 feedback branch. Also, the commits could have been a bit more 
 descriptive, simply saying "follow instructions" doesn't really tell the reader what you added/pushed on to git.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code review for ShutongChen9](https://github.com/ShutongChen9/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

This was one of my earlier code review and thus is quite short and sweet. 
I mostly asked them about the lack of time estimates and the incorrect naming of the python files

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would try to include some more on paper coding practice in class/lecture/weekly in-person pracs. 
I feel that I rely too much on pycharm's auto complete for coding and once I have to code on paper I am completely lost.
If we had some more practice on paper in person it would help massively, (if you ask someone to do it at home for the 
weekly prac deliverables they will not do it on paper first, it'll be done on pycharm first then transcribed to paper).

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Getting all my deliverables done on time, except for week 10's
(got swept up in another assessment for programming and another subject and forgot about the prac). 
I managed to get everything done on time.
