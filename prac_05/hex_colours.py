"""CP1404 Practical 5 - Hex Colours"""

"""Based on the state name example program above, create a program that allows 
you to look up hexadecimal colour codes like those at http://www.color-hex.com/color-names.html

Use a constant dictionary of about 10 colour names and write a program that allows a user 
to enter a name and get the code, e.g., entering AliceBlue (or aliceblue - make it case-independent) should show #f0f8ff.

Entering an invalid colour name should not crash the program.
Allow the user to enter names until they enter a blank one to stop the loop.

Note
We have just done two exercises that use dictionaries that are constants and named in ALL_CAPS.
Please don't think this is any kind of rule or pattern.
Dictionaries that change would not be constants."""
